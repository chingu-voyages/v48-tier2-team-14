# Dino-Studio

Welcome to the Dino-Studio, an exciting educational app to learn all about dinosaurs! Search our list of dinos, see where in the world they were found, who named them, and read about their habitat, diet, and more. Whether you would like to dive into the latest dinosaur discoveries from around the world or uncover something new about your favorite prehistoric reptile, Dino-Studio is the place to be.

How about we create an app all about dinosaurs? We've got our data all
set from the National History Museum that tells us about different dinosaurs.

Imagine our app like a dino world! We can show all kinds of dinosaurs – big ones
looking for food, calm ones eating plants, and even tiny ones running around. From
huge dinosaurs that made the ground shake to little ones in the forests.

And get this, our tool might even let us time-travel! Imagine going back in time to
see how these dinosaurs lived. Plus, it tells us what type of dinosaur it is and
where it used to call home. So, you'll get to know dinosaurs from all over the place.

We're thinking of adding a cool twist – using News data to show you the latest
discoveries about dinosaurs. Pretty cool, huh?

Let's make an app that's not just smart but also super fun for everyone!


Your Chingu Voyage team will be using this data to create an web app that will help
anyone interested to be able to “dig” into the fossil data and discover facts
about dinosaurs in a unique way. Your app will summarize this data and will allow
users to apply a single filter to multiple visualizations simultaneously.

This will provide you with an opportunity to build Web Development experience
dealing with large volumes of dinosaurs & news data, charts, maps, and user queries.

## General Instructions

This project is designed to be worked on by a team rather than an individual
Chingu. This means you and your team will need to thoroughly read and
understand the requirements and specifications below, **_and_** define and
manage your project following the _Agile Methodology_ defined in the
[Voyage Handbook](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/Handbook/blob/main/docs/guides/voyage/voyage.md#voyage-guide).

As you create this project make sure it meets all of the requirements, but once
it reaches MVP, start implementing the optional features or get creative and
extend it in ways we haven't envisioned. In other words, use the power of
teamwork to make it distinctive and unique.

Take note that we haven't given specific direction on what your UI/UX should
look like. This is another area where you and your team can put your creativity
to work!
